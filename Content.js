		<h2> The Universe </h2>
		<p>The universe is all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10] including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. 
		The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. </p>

		<p>According to this theory, space and time emerged together 13.787±0.020 billion years ago,[11] and the universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang. 
		While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, 
		which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.</p>

		<p> A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter, bound together by gravity.[1][2] 
		The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. 
		Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known – 
		supergiants with one hundred trillion stars,[4] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, 
		with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies. </p>
		

	<a id="Galaxies"></a>	<h1> multiverse</h1>
		<p>Imagine setting off in a rocket and leaving Earth. Leaving the solar system. Leaving our galaxy. Breaking through the edge of the observable universe and leaving our cosmos behind (which would be impossible, as you'd have to go faster than the speed of light, but work with me here).

Now you are cruising through the unfathomable void for eons, only to come upon another universe, with another galaxy inside it, with another solar system, another Earth … and another you, sitting there, reading this article.

This is the multiverse, and it might be a natural prediction of the physical theories that define the beginning of the universe. Or it might not. It's tough to say, as new research has shown.</p>

<h1> Galaxies</h1>
<p>A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter, bound together by gravity.[1][2] 
The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. 
Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, 
to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars,[4] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. 
Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. 
Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.</p>
<br></br>		<p>Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is typical: it has hundreds of billions of stars, enough gas and dust to make billions more stars, and at least ten times as much dark matter as all the stars and gas put together. And it’s all held together by gravity.

Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the center of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are being generated. Based on the immense gravity that would be required to explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the astronomers conclude that the center of the Milky Way is a supermassive black hole.</p>
